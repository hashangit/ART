# `PESAgent` Error Handling Improvements

## 1. Overview

This document outlines a plan to improve the error handling capabilities of the `PESAgent` in the ART framework. The current implementation has a general `try...catch` block, but it could be more robust in handling specific failures during the Plan-Execute-Synthesize cycle, especially those related to asynchronous A2A and MCP operations.

## 2. Identified Weaknesses

1.  **A2A Task Failure**: If an A2A task delegation or execution fails, the agent currently logs the error and continues to the synthesis step with incomplete information. It does not have a strategy to recover from this failure.
2.  **MCP Tool Call Failure**: Similarly, if a critical MCP tool call fails, the agent proceeds to synthesis, which may result in a poor or incorrect final response.
3.  **Lack of Retry Logic**: There is no retry mechanism for failed A2A or MCP operations within the agent's workflow.
4.  **State Management on Failure**: The agent's state might not be correctly updated or cleaned up when a critical error occurs mid-process.

## 3. Proposed Improvements

### Step 1: Introduce a Recovery Mechanism in the `PESAgent`

The main `process` loop in `PESAgent` should be updated to handle errors from the A2A and MCP systems more intelligently.

*   **Catch Specific Errors**: The `catch` blocks for `_performDiscoveryAndDelegation` and `_executeLocalTools` should be more specific.
*   **Re-planning Step**: If a critical A2A task or MCP tool fails, the agent should have the option to trigger a **re-planning step**.
    *   The agent would call the `_performPlanning` method again, but this time, the prompt would include the context of the failure.
    *   For example: `"The tool 'get_weather' failed with the error: 'API limit exceeded'. Create a new plan to answer the user's query without this tool, or by using an alternative tool if available."`
    *   This would allow the agent to dynamically adapt its plan and potentially still fulfill the user's request.

### Step 2: Configurable Retry Logic

The `ArtInstanceConfig` could be extended to allow developers to configure retry logic for A2A and MCP operations.

```typescript
export interface ArtInstanceConfig {
  // ... existing properties ...

  /** Optional: Configuration for agent error handling. */
  errorHandlingConfig?: {
    /** Number of times to retry a failed A2A task. */
    a2aRetryCount?: number;
    /** Number of times to retry a failed MCP tool call. */
    mcpRetryCount?: number;
  };
}
```

The `PESAgent` would then use this configuration to automatically retry failed operations before triggering the re-planning step.

### Step 3: Improved State Management on Failure

The `finally` block in the `PESAgent.process` method should be enhanced to ensure that the agent's state is always saved correctly, even if an error occurs.

*   It should also record a detailed error observation that includes the phase of the process where the error occurred and the state of the agent at that time.

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **Refactor `PESAgent.process`**: Modify the main `try...catch` block to include a re-planning loop.
2.  **Update `ArtInstanceConfig`**: Add the `errorHandlingConfig` property.
3.  **Implement Retry Logic**: Add retry logic to the `_performDiscoveryAndDelegation` and `_executeLocalTools` methods, based on the new configuration.
4.  **Enhance `finally` Block**: Improve the state saving and error logging in the `finally` block.

These improvements will make the `PESAgent` more resilient and robust, allowing it to handle failures more gracefully and increase its chances of successfully completing tasks.
