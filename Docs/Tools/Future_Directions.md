# ART Tool System: Future Directions

The ART framework is designed with extensibility in mind. While the current primary method for adding tools involves implementing the native `IToolExecutor` interface (see [Creating Native Tools](./Creating_Native_Tools.md)), several enhancements and alternative integration methods are planned for the Tool System based on the project roadmap and architectural vision.

This document provides a brief overview of these planned future directions.

## Planned Tool Integration Methods

*   **MCP (Machine-readable Capability Protocol) Support:**
    *   **Goal:** Allow ART agents to utilize tools exposed by external servers adhering to the MCP standard.
    *   **Vision:** Simplified integration where the `ToolRegistry` potentially handles discovery and setup, allowing developers to use MCP tools with minimal boilerplate.
*   **LangChain Tool Adapters:**
    *   **Goal:** Enable the use of tools already defined within the LangChain ecosystem directly within ART.
    *   **Vision:** Provide adapter layers that wrap LangChain tools, making them compatible with the `ToolRegistry` and `ToolSystem`.
*   **WASM (WebAssembly) Tools:**
    *   **Goal:** Execute tool logic compiled to WebAssembly within a secure, sandboxed browser environment.
    *   **Vision:** Enhance security and potentially allow for more complex or performance-sensitive tools to run client-side safely.

## Planned Tool System Enhancements

*   **Parallel Tool Execution:**
    *   **Current:** The `ToolSystem` executes requested tools sequentially.
    *   **Future:** Enhance the `ToolSystem` to optionally execute independent tool calls in parallel, potentially speeding up agent execution when multiple tools are needed.
*   **Tool Result Caching:**
    *   **Goal:** Improve performance and reduce redundant computations or API calls.
    *   **Future:** Implement a caching mechanism within the `ToolSystem` or `ToolRegistry` to store and reuse the results of tool calls with identical inputs, based on configurable caching strategies.
*   **Execution Timeouts:**
    *   **Goal:** Prevent runaway or long-running tools from blocking agent execution indefinitely.
    *   **Future:** Add configurable timeout limits to the `ToolSystem`'s execution logic.

These planned features aim to make the ART Tool System more versatile, powerful, secure, and efficient, offering developers a wider range of options for integrating capabilities into their agents. Keep an eye on the project's roadmap and changelog for updates on their implementation status.
