# ART Framework Review - Revised Plan

1.  **Deep Dive into Concepts:** Meticulously re-examine conceptual documents (`ART-Concept` files, `ART-PRD-Checklist-plan.md`, execution flow, PRD) focusing on specific functional requirements, data structures, and component interactions.
2.  **In-Depth Code Review & Comparison:** Use `read_file` to analyze implementation details of key files (`pes-agent.ts`, `StateManager.ts`, `ConversationManager.ts`, `ToolSystem.ts`, `ReasoningEngine.ts`, `OutputParser.ts`, `PromptManager.ts`, etc.) and compare against conceptual requirements (method logic, data structures, interactions, error handling).
3.  **Refined Analysis & Synthesis:** Re-assess functional alignment, identify specific logical discrepancies, provide a more accurate functional completeness estimate, and update the list of gaps.
4.  **Update Report Outline:** Refine the report outline based on the detailed analysis.
5.  **Seek Revised Plan Approval:** Present the revised plan and updated outline for approval. (Completed)
6.  **Offer Plan Documentation:** Ask if the user wants the plan saved to markdown. (Completed)
7.  **Request Mode Switch:** Request switch to another mode to generate the detailed report.

# Proposed Final Report Outline (Markdown)

## 1. Introduction
    *   Purpose of the review.
    *   Methodology (Document analysis, Code structure review, In-depth code reading for core components).
    *   Scope (Comparison against provided conceptual documents and v1.0 PRD/Checklist).

## 2. Conceptual Framework Summary
    *   Brief overview of ART's vision.
    *   Key subsystems.
    *   Core execution pattern (PES for v1.0).

## 3. Codebase Implementation Overview
    *   Summary of `src` directory structure.
    *   Confirmation of key component implementations.

## 4. Alignment Analysis
    *   Architectural Alignment (Structure vs. Docs).
    *   Component Responsibility Alignment (Detailed review of `PESAgent`, `StateManager`, `ConversationManager`, `ToolSystem`, `ReasoningEngine`, `OutputParser`, `PromptManager`, `ObservationManager` logic vs. PRD).
    *   Execution Flow Alignment (`PESAgent` logic vs. Flow Diagram).

## 5. Completeness Assessment (vs. v1.0 PRD/Checklist)
    *   Review of checklist phases based on implemented files/definitions and logic.
    *   Estimated Percentage Completion (v1.0): High (~90-95%, justification).

## 6. Functionality & Integration Assessment
    *   Component Interactions (Observed calls, data passing between reviewed components).
    *   Error Handling (Presence and apparent correctness in key components).
    *   Testing Coverage (Inferred from `.test.ts` files).
    *   Caveats (Runtime verification needed).

## 7. Identified Gaps & Discrepancies
    *   **Minor Implementation TODOs/Gaps (v1.0):**
        *   Observation recording call within `ToolSystem`.
        *   Tool execution timeouts implementation in `ToolSystem`.
        *   State modification logic & `StateManager.saveStateIfModified` implementation.
    *   **Features Not Implemented (Expected Future Work):** (WASM LLM/VectorDB, Multi-Agent, MCP, etc.).

## 8. Answers to Specific Questions
    *   (Answers refined based on deeper review).

## 9. Key Insights & Potential Challenges
    *   (Insights reinforced by deeper review).

## 10. Conclusion & Recommendations
    *   (Recommendations focused on addressing the identified v1.0 gaps).
