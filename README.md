# ✨ ART: Agentic Runtime Framework <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-v0.3.1-blue" alt="Version 0.3.1">

**ART is a powerful, modular, and browser-first TypeScript framework for building sophisticated LLM-powered agents capable of complex reasoning, planning, and tool usage.**

It provides the building blocks for creating robust agentic systems that can run entirely client-side, emphasizing user privacy, offline capability, and deep observability, while also supporting server-side deployments.

## Overview

Existing agent frameworks often rely on server-side components, limiting their use in web applications where user privacy or offline functionality is critical. ART is engineered to address this gap by providing a comprehensive, standalone toolkit designed for the browser, while remaining powerful enough for server-side execution.

**Core Goals:**
*   **Browser-First:** Enable complex agent logic to run directly in the user's browser, enhancing privacy and reducing server costs.
*   **Modularity:** Offer distinct, replaceable components for storage, reasoning, and tools.
*   **Observability:** Provide deep, real-time insights into the agent's internal thought process.
*   **Developer Experience:** Deliver a layered API that is simple for basic use cases yet powerful enough for advanced customization.

## Key Features

#### Reasoning & Orchestration
*   **Swappable Agent Cores:** Start with the default Plan-Execute-Synthesize (`PESAgent`) pattern and seamlessly switch to or create custom reasoning patterns (e.g., ReAct, Chain of Thought).
*   **Streaming-First:** Native support for streaming LLM responses, enabling real-time, interactive user experiences.
*   **Dynamic Prompt Management:** A powerful system for constructing prompts from blueprints with dynamic context injection.
*   **Agent Persona Customization:** Easily define your agent's identity and default system prompt through a simple configuration object.
*   **Rich Observability:** A detailed, typed `Observation` system provides transparent insights into every step of an agent's operation for debugging, monitoring, and visualization.

#### Connectivity & Data
*   **Multi-Provider Support:** A centralized `ProviderManager` allows runtime selection and configuration of multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter, and local models via Ollama).
*   **Pluggable Storage:** A flexible `StorageAdapter` interface allows easy integration with any storage backend (default support for IndexedDB, InMemory, and Supabase).
*   **Schema-Driven Tooling:** A robust tool integration system with automatic schema validation and secure execution.
*   **Dynamic Tool Loading (MCP):** Support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables agents to dynamically discover and use tools from compliant external servers.

#### Developer Experience
*   **Browser-First Design:** Built to run fully in the browser, enabling privacy-preserving and offline-capable applications.
*   **Flexible UI Integration:** A typed, publish/subscribe socket system allows for reactive UI updates with fine-grained event filtering.
*   **TypeScript-Native:** Engineered from the ground up with TypeScript for a robust, type-safe development experience.

## Architecture: The 3 Nodes

ART's architecture is best understood as three interconnected nodes:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Node 1: Developer Interface\n(Your Code & Config)"] -- Configures & Invokes --> B["Node 2: ART Core Orchestration\n(The Framework's Brain)"]
    B -- Manages & Uses --> C["Node 3: External Dependencies & Interactions\n(LLMs, Tools, Storage)"]
    C -- Provides Data/Services --> B
    B -- Streams Results/Updates --> A
```

*   **Node 1: Developer Interface (Your Code & Config):** This is your interaction point with ART. You use `createArtInstance` to configure the framework, selecting your storage, LLM providers, and tools. You then invoke the agent via the `art.process()` method.
*   **Node 2: ART Core Orchestration (The Framework's Brain):** This is the internal engine that manages the agent's lifecycle. It orchestrates state, reasons with LLMs, constructs prompts, executes tools, and broadcasts updates to your UI. The selected `Agent Core` (e.g., `PESAgent`) dictates the high-level reasoning strategy used here.
*   **Node 3: External Dependencies & Interactions (The Outside World):** This node represents the external services ART connects to. This includes LLM APIs (like OpenAI), your custom tool logic, and storage backends (like IndexedDB or a remote database).

## Installation

```bash
npm install art-framework
# or
pnpm install art-framework
# or
yarn add art-framework
```

## Quick Start

This example demonstrates setting up a simple agent that uses OpenAI and runs in-memory. For a complete example with all configurations, see the [Comprehensive Developer Guide](./docs/README.md).

```typescript
import { 
  createArtInstance, 
  ArtInstanceConfig, 
  ThreadConfig,
  CalculatorTool,
  OpenAIAdapter, 
  GeminiAdapter 
} from 'art-framework';

// --- 1. Configure the ART Instance ---
// Note: No API keys or secrets are present here.

const artConfig: ArtInstanceConfig = {
  storage: { 
    type: 'indexedDB', 
    dbName: 'MyCorrectChatDB'
  },
  providers: {
    availableProviders: [
      { name: 'openai', adapter: OpenAIAdapter },
      { name: 'gemini', adapter: GeminiAdapter }
    ]
  },
  tools: [new CalculatorTool()],
  persona: {
    name: 'ConfigExpert',
    prompts: {
      synthesis: 'You explain configurations clearly.'
    }
  },
  logger: { level: 'info' }
};


// --- 2. Main Application Logic ---

async function initializeAndRun() {
  // Create the ART instance with the high-level configuration.
  const art = await createArtInstance(artConfig);
  console.log('ART Instance Initialized.');

  // --- 3. Set Up a New Conversation Thread ---
  const threadId = 'user-123-session-1';

  // Create the thread-specific configuration.
  // THIS is where you specify the provider, model, and API key.
  const threadConfig: ThreadConfig = {
    providerConfig: {
      providerName: 'openai', // Must match a name from availableProviders
      modelId: 'gpt-4o',
      adapterOptions: {
        apiKey: 'sk-your-real-openai-api-key', // Securely provide your API key here
        temperature: 0.7
      }
    },
    // Other thread settings
    enabledTools: ['CalculatorTool'],
    historyLimit: 20
  };

  // Save this configuration for the new thread.
  // This step is crucial and must be done before the first `process` call.
  await art.stateManager.setThreadConfig(threadId, threadConfig);
  console.log(`ThreadConfig set for threadId: ${threadId}`);
  
  // Now the ART instance is ready to process requests for this thread.
  console.log('Sending first message...');
  const response = await art.process({
    query: 'What is 2 + 2?',
    threadId: threadId
  });

  console.log('Final response:', response.response.content);
}

initializeAndRun().catch(console.error);
```

*(Note: Replace `'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'` with your actual key. In a real application, load this from a secure source like environment variables or a secrets manager.)*
