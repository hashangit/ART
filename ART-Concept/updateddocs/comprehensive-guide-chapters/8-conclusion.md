ART offers a layered approach to building browser-based AI agents. Developers can start simply by configuring built-in components, progress to extending capabilities with custom tools and adapters, and finally achieve deep customization by implementing entirely new agent reasoning patterns. Recent advancements, such as the flexible prompt management system using blueprints and the implementation of real-time LLM response streaming, further enhance ART's capabilities. By understanding the 3-node architecture and the different usage levels, you can effectively leverage ART to create powerful and flexible client-side AI applications.
