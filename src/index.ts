/**
 * ART (Agentic Reasoning & Tool-use) Framework - Main Entry Point
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Welcome to the ART framework! This file is the primary public API surface for the library.
 * It's structured to provide a clear and intuitive experience for developers,
 * whether you're just getting started or building advanced, custom agentic systems.
 *
 * --- Quick Start ---
 * For most use cases, you'll only need `createArtInstance` and the associated types.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```ts
 * import { createArtInstance } from 'art-framework';
 * import type { ArtInstanceConfig } from 'art-framework';
 *
 * const config: ArtInstanceConfig = {
 *   storage: { type: 'memory' },
 *   providers: {
 *     openai: { adapter: 'openai', apiKey: '...' }
 *   },
 *   tools: [new CalculatorTool()],
 *   persona: {
 *     name: 'MyAgent',
 *     prompts: {
 *       synthesis: 'You are MyAgent. Always answer in rhyme.'
 *     }
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * const art = await createArtInstance(config);
 * const response = await art.process({ query: "Hello, world!" });
 * ```
 *
 * --- API Structure ---
 * 1.  **Core Factory**: The main function to create an ART instance.
 * 2.  **Primary Interfaces & Types**: Essential types for configuration and interaction.
 * 3.  **Built-in Components**: Concrete implementations of adapters, tools, and agents.
 * 4.  **Advanced Systems & Managers**: Lower-level components for building custom logic.
 * 5.  **Utilities**: Helper functions and classes.

// --- 1. Core Factory ---

 * assembling all necessary components based on the provided configuration.
 * @param {ArtInstanceConfig} config - The configuration object for the ART instance.
 * @returns {Promise<ArtInstance>} A promise that resolves to a ready-to-use ART instance.
 * @see {@link ArtInstanceConfig} for configuration options.
